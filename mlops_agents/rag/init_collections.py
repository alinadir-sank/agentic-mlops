## What It Is
Concept drift occurs when the statistical relationship between input features and the fraud label changes.
Fraudsters change techniques. Previously V14 high = fraud. Now fraud exploits different feature combinations.
The model is confidently wrong — not uncertain.
 
## How to Identify
- recall < 0.55 (key signal — model missing fraud)
- precision remains high (model still confident, just wrong)
- drift_score moderate (0.20–0.45) — inputs look similar but labels changed
- accuracy drop lags recall drop by several cycles
- prediction confidence distribution remains bimodal (model not uncertain, just wrong)
 
## How to Distinguish from Data Drift
- Data drift: drift_score high (>0.45), model uncertain, probabilities cluster near 0.5
- Concept drift: drift_score moderate, precision high, recall collapsed
- Mixed: both signals present simultaneously
 
## Remediation Steps
1. Confirm recall < 0.55 for at least 2 consecutive monitor cycles
2. Retrain with strategy: drift_period_only
3. Set drift_period_weight=2.0 (upsample recent data where new pattern is present)
4. Set optimize_for=recall — catching fraud is more important than precision
5. Set target_recall=0.82 minimum
6. Deploy with canary strategy at 10% traffic
7. Monitor recall for 2 hours before promoting to 100%
 
## Prescription Template
- data_strategy: drift_period_only
- window_days: 14 (focus on recent period where new pattern emerged)
- drift_period_weight: 2.0
- optimize_for: recall
- target_recall: 0.82
- target_roc_auc: 0.88
- deployment_strategy: canary
- canary_traffic_pct: 10
 
## Post-Remediation Checks
- recall should recover to > 0.80 within 2 monitor cycles
- if recall recovers but precision drops below 0.40, widen window_days to 21
- if recall does not recover, the new fraud pattern may require feature engineering — escalate to data science team
 
## Historical Outcomes
- 2024-Q1: V14/V17 pattern shift. drift_period_only + recall optimization resolved in 3 cycles.
- 2024-Q3: Amount-based fraud pattern. Required feature engineering alongside retrain.

## What It Is
The statistical distribution of input features changes. A new merchant category enters the platform.
Geographic expansion brings different transaction patterns. Seasonal effects shift Amount distribution.
The model sees unfamiliar inputs — not a label relationship change.
 
## How to Identify
- drift_score > 0.35 (primary signal)
- accuracy degrades gradually (not suddenly)
- recall and accuracy degrade together (model uncertain, not wrong)
- prediction confidence distribution shifts toward 0.5 (uncertainty rising)
- latency unaffected
 
## Remediation Steps
1. Identify which features drifted — check per-feature PSI if available
2. Retrain with strategy: recent_window
3. window_days: derive from drift onset. Recent drift (< 7 days) use 14. Gradual (weeks) use 30–60.
4. Set drift_period_weight=1.5 if drift_score 0.35–0.55, 2.0 if > 0.55
5. refit_preprocessors=true if Amount or Time features drifted (scaler needs update)
6. Deploy with canary for drift_score > 0.45, immediate for 0.35–0.45
 
## Prescription Template
- data_strategy: recent_window
- window_days: 21 (adjust based on drift onset)
- drift_period_weight: 1.5–2.0
- refit_preprocessors: true if Amount_scaled or Time_scaled in drifted_features
- optimize_for: recall
- deployment_strategy: canary (drift_score > 0.45) or immediate
 
## Common Causes
- New merchant category onboarded (Amount distribution shifts right)
- Geographic expansion (V-feature distributions shift)
- Seasonal patterns (Time feature distribution shifts)
- Upstream data pipeline schema change (sudden step-function drift)
 
## If Drift Recurs Within 7 Days
Suspect upstream data pipeline change rather than natural distribution shift.
Check: feature encoding, normalization pipeline, data source schema.
Action: investigate rather than retrain again.
 
## Post-Remediation Checks
- drift_score should fall below 0.20 within 3 monitor cycles
- if drift persists, the new distribution may be a permanent shift — update reference distribution

## What It Is
p99 or p95 latency exceeds threshold while model accuracy and drift remain healthy.
This is an infrastructure problem, not a model quality problem. Do not retrain.
 
## How to Identify
- latency_ms > 1000 (major) or > 2000 (critical)
- accuracy within normal range (> 0.80)
- drift_score within normal range (< 0.25)
- error_rate may be rising due to timeouts, not model failures
 
## CRITICAL
If accuracy is also degraded, do not assume latency is the root cause.
High latency + low accuracy = possible model complexity issue from recent retrain.
Check model version and retrain date before scaling.
 
## Remediation Steps
1. Confirm accuracy and drift are healthy before acting
2. Action: scale (double replica count)
3. Check pod CPU/memory — OOMKill causes latency spikes
4. Check if a recent deployment changed model complexity (GBM depth increase)
5. Do NOT retrain — retraining does not fix serving infrastructure
 
## Prescription
- recommended_action: scale
- no retrain prescription needed
- if scaling does not resolve within 5 minutes, investigate pod logs
 
## Kubernetes Commands (if manual intervention needed)
kubectl get pods -n ml-production
kubectl top pods -n ml-production
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n ml-production
 
## Post-Remediation Checks
- latency should recover within 3 minutes of scaling
- if latency persists after scaling, check node-level metrics
- consider adding HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) if spikes are recurring
 
## When to Escalate
- latency spike coincides with a recent deployment → rollback
- latency spike with OOMKill → increase memory limits
- latency spike with no other signals and no recent changes → investigate

## How to Identify
- error_rate rising (this is computed from real inference exceptions, not estimated)
- may accompany latency spike (failed requests still consume time)
- accuracy metrics may be misleading (failed requests excluded from accuracy computation)
 
## Common Causes
1. Schema change upstream — transaction payload missing fields or wrong types
2. NaN or null values in features — upstream data pipeline bug
3. Model artifact corruption — unlikely but possible after bad retrain
4. Memory error during inference — model too large for pod memory
 
## Remediation Decision Tree
- error_rate high + accuracy healthy + recent schema change → investigate (open GitHub issue)
- error_rate high + accuracy healthy + no schema change → investigate (check serving logs)
- error_rate high + accuracy degraded + recent retrain → rollback
- error_rate high + latency high + accuracy healthy → scale first, then investigate
 
## What NOT to Do
- Do not retrain to fix error_rate — retrain does not fix serving failures
- Do not rollback without confirming accuracy also degraded

- open GitHub issue with error logs and recent deployment history
- include sample of malformed requests if available
 
## Post-Remediation Checks

## What It Is
Accuracy or recall degrades immediately after a new model deployment.
The retrained model performs worse than the model it replaced.
Distinct from gradual drift — regression is sudden and correlates with deployment event.
 
## How to Identify
- accuracy drops within 1–2 monitor cycles of a deployment
- previous model_version tag in metrics_history shows healthy metrics
- current model_version tag shows degraded metrics
- drift_score may be low (not a data problem — model problem)
 
## Remediation Steps
1. Confirm degradation started after deployment (check metrics_history timestamps vs deployment time)
2. Confirm drift_score is NOT the primary signal (if drift high, retrain again with better prescription)
3. Action: rollback
4. Helm rollback to previous revision
5. Verify metrics recover within 2 monitor cycles
 
## When Rollback is Correct
- accuracy dropped > 0.08 points immediately after deployment
- recall dropped > 0.10 points immediately after deployment
- no corresponding drift_score increase
 
## When Rollback is WRONG
- drift is high — rolling back to the old model returns a model that already failed on new distribution
- error_rate is the primary signal — rollback won't fix serving infrastructure
 
## Post-Rollback Checks
- metrics should return to pre-deployment baseline within 2 cycles
- if metrics do not recover after rollback, the degradation is not deployment-related — investigate
 
## Root Cause Analysis After Rollback
- Review retrain prescription: was window_days appropriate?
- Review validation gate: did roc_auc and recall pass thresholds?
- If validation passed but production failed: test set may not represent production distribution
- Increase canary_traffic_pct monitoring period before next promotion

## What It Is
Accuracy declines slowly over weeks. No sudden event. No clear drift signal.
The model was trained months ago. Fraud patterns evolve. Model becomes increasingly stale.
 
## How to Identify
- accuracy declining 0.01–0.03 per week over 3+ weeks
- drift_score mildly elevated (0.15–0.30) but not alarming
- recall declining alongside accuracy (not a concept drift pattern)
- metrics_history trend shows sustained downward slope
 
## How to Distinguish from Concept/Data Drift
- Staleness: slow decline over weeks, mild drift signal, recall and accuracy decay together
- Concept drift: sudden recall collapse, precision stays high
- Data drift: drift_score > 0.35 is the primary signal
 
## Remediation Steps
1. Confirm trend is sustained — at least 3 consecutive monitor cycles declining
2. Check days since last retrain — if > 30 days, staleness is likely primary cause
3. Retrain with strategy: weighted_recent or full_history
4. weighted_recent: use all historical data but upsample last 30 days
5. full_history: if fraud patterns have shifted seasonally and old data is still relevant
6. Upgrade model architecture if appropriate — LogisticRegression → GradientBoosting
 
## Prescription Template
- data_strategy: weighted_recent
- window_days: 60 (captures recent trend without discarding history)
- drift_period_weight: 1.5
- optimize_for: recall
- target_recall: 0.80
- deployment_strategy: canary (gradual promotion, monitor for regression)
 
## Scheduling Note
Consider proactive retraining on a schedule (every 30 days) rather than waiting for degradation.
Reactive retraining for staleness always results in some period of degraded performance.
 
## Post-Remediation Checks
- accuracy should recover to > 0.88 within 3 monitor cycles
- if accuracy does not recover, staleness was not the primary cause — investigate drift

## What It Is
Both the input distribution and the fraud label relationship have changed simultaneously.
The most severe and hardest-to-diagnose failure mode.
Typically occurs during major platform changes or large-scale fraud pattern shifts.
 
## How to Identify
- drift_score high (> 0.45) AND recall collapsed (< 0.55)
- accuracy severely degraded
- prediction confidence distribution unpredictable
- severity: critical in almost all cases
 
## Why It's Hard to Diagnose
- drift_score rising could be data drift alone
- recall collapse could be concept drift alone
- together they are mixed and require aggressive remediation
 
## Remediation Steps
1. Do not attempt to separate the signals — treat as mixed
2. data_strategy: drift_period_only (focus entirely on recent data where both shifts occurred)
3. drift_period_weight: 2.0 (upsample aggressively)
4. window_days: 14 (tight window — only the period after both shifts)
5. optimize_for: recall (fraud safety is priority)
6. deployment_strategy: canary with extended shadow period (4 hours minimum)
7. Do NOT use full_history — historical data reflects neither the new distribution nor the new patterns

- deployment_strategy: canary
- canary_traffic_pct: 10
- shadow_period_hours: 4
 
## If Retrain Fails Validation Gate
- roc_auc or recall below threshold after training on drift period
- the drift period may be too short to train a good model
- increase window_days to 21 and retrain again
- if still failing: escalate to data science team for feature engineering
 
## Post-Remediation Checks
- both drift_score and recall must recover
- drift_score < 0.20 AND recall > 0.80 before considering resolved
- monitor for 48 hours after full promotion — mixed drift can recur

## Incident Summary
Duration: 4 hours 22 minutes
Severity: Major
Impact: fraud detection recall dropped from 0.88 to 0.61
Root cause: New premium merchant category onboarded — Amount distribution shifted significantly
 
## Timeline
- 14:00 UTC: New merchant category enabled in production
- 14:35 UTC: Monitor agent detected drift_score=0.41 → major severity
- 14:38 UTC: Human approval requested (major severity gate)
- 14:51 UTC: Approval given, retrain dispatched
- 16:47 UTC: Retrain completed, model hot-reloaded
- 18:22 UTC: Metrics confirmed recovered, incident closed
 
## Root Cause
Premium merchant transactions average $2,400 vs $85 baseline.
Amount_scaled feature shifted +3.2 standard deviations from training distribution.
Model was trained almost entirely on sub-$500 transactions.
High-value legitimate transactions were being flagged as fraud (false positives).
Recall dropped because the fraud boundary shifted with the Amount distribution.
 
## What Worked
- Monitor agent detected drift within 35 minutes of merchant enablement
- RAG retrieved similar historical incident (2023-Q4 geographic expansion)
- Diagnosis correctly identified data_drift with Amount_scaled as primary feature
- Prescription used recent_window with refit_preprocessors=true (scaler needed update)
 
## What Did Not Work
- Human approval added 13 minutes — major severity gate was correct but slow
- Retrain took 1h56m — GradientBoosting on full window was slower than needed
- Should have used drift_period_only with shorter window (14 days sufficient)
 
## Action Items
- Add Amount_scaled to feature drift monitoring dashboard
- Pre-stage scaler refit when new merchant categories are onboarded
- Consider reducing major severity approval window to 5 minutes for known drift patterns
- Runbook updated with Amount-specific prescription
 
## Prescription That Resolved It
- data_strategy: recent_window
- window_days: 30
- drift_period_weight: 1.5
- refit_preprocessors: true
- drifted_features: [Amount_scaled]
- optimize_for: recall
- deployment_strategy: canary
